# Introduction

## The Mamoru Network
Mamoru, which means "protect" in Japanese, is a decentralized network dedicated to monitoring and responding to smart contract exploits in near real-time. Its primary objective is to ensure the security and integrity of blockchain systems and their associated smart contracts.

As a real-time detection solution, Mamoru focuses on both security and operational monitoring of blockchain activity. By utilizing advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, the network is able to identify potential vulnerabilities and exploits in smart contracts, as well as monitor and respond to any suspicious transactions or malicious activities.

The decentralized nature of Mamoru allows for a highly resilient and distributed system, free from single points of failure, making it a reliable solution for protecting decentralized applications (dApps), cryptocurrencies, and other blockchain-based platforms. This unique approach to security ensures that Mamoru can adapt and integrate seamlessly with a variety of blockchain ecosystems, providing end-users with an effective and robust defense against smart contract exploits and other potential threats.

This guide aims to assist you in your development journey for Mamoru by explaining the core concepts of real-time blockchain cybersecurity threat detection. By understanding these key concepts, you will be better equipped to develop and implement effective security measures within the Mamoru network.

1. Decentralized Network: Mamoru's decentralized network is designed to eliminate single points of failure, ensuring resilience and reliability. This distributed architecture enables the system to function efficiently and securely, protecting blockchain systems from threats even if a portion of the network is compromised.

2. Real-time Monitoring: Mamoru constantly monitors blockchain activity, detecting and analyzing transactions, smart contract executions, and other relevant events as they occur. This real-time monitoring allows Mamoru to rapidly identify and respond to threats and vulnerabilities, minimizing potential damage.

3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Mamoru leverages advanced AI and ML algorithms to analyze blockchain data, detect patterns, and identify potential threats or anomalies. These technologies allow the system to adapt and improve its detection capabilities over time, ensuring it remains effective against evolving threats.

4. Smart Contract Exploits: A primary focus of Mamoru is identifying and responding to smart contract exploits. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code. They can be vulnerable to exploits due to coding errors, design flaws, or other issues. Mamoru's ability to detect and respond to these exploits in near real-time is essential to protect the integrity of the underlying blockchain systems.

5. Integration and Adaptability: Mamoru is designed to seamlessly integrate with various blockchain ecosystems, providing flexible and adaptable security solutions. This adaptability ensures that Mamoru can effectively protect a wide range of blockchain platforms and technologies.

6. Proactive Threat Detection: Mamoru emphasizes proactive threat detection, working to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. By actively scanning and analyzing blockchain data, Mamoru can detect potential weaknesses and implement appropriate countermeasures to prevent exploitation.

By understanding these core concepts of real-time blockchain cybersecurity threat detection, developers can better leverage the capabilities of the Mamoru network and build more secure and reliable blockchain systems. This understanding will enable you to make informed decisions regarding the design and implementation of security measures within your own blockchain projects, ultimately helping to protect the assets and operations of your users.
