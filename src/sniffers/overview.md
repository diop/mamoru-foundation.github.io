# Introduction to Sniffers

Sniffers play a crucial role in the Mamoru ecosystem, and in this introduction, we'll provide an overview of their purpose, functionality, and how they contribute to the security of the network.

## What are Sniffers?

Sniffers are specialized nodes within the Mamoru network that monitor and analyze transactions and events in real-time. Their primary function is to detect and report suspicious activities or incidents based on customizable rules defined in SQL or WASM. By continuously scanning the blockchain for potential threats, Sniffers help maintain the overall security and integrity of the network.

## Key Functions of Sniffers

Sniffers perform several essential tasks within the Mamoru ecosystem:

1. **Monitoring Transactions and Events:** Sniffers continuously observe and process transactions, events, and state changes within the supported blockchains.

2. **Applying Custom Rules:** Sniffers apply user-defined SQL or WASM rules to detect incidents, allowing for highly customizable monitoring tailored to specific needs and requirements.

3. **Real-time Incident Reporting:** When an incident is detected, Sniffers quickly relay the information to the validation chain, enabling prompt and automated defensive actions.

4. **Supporting Cross-Chain Analysis:** Sniffers can operate across different chains and contracts, enabling the detection of complex threats and attack scenarios that span multiple blockchains.

## How Sniffers Enhance Security

By actively monitoring and analyzing on-chain activities, Sniffers provide an additional layer of security to the blockchain ecosystem. Their real-time detection and reporting capabilities enable users to swiftly react to potential threats and mitigate risks. The customizable rules engine allows Sniffers to adapt to a variety of use cases, making them an essential tool for securing critical infrastructure, DeFi platforms, DAOs, exchanges, and more.

In conclusion, Sniffers are a vital component of the Mamoru network, providing real-time monitoring, detection, and incident reporting to maintain a secure and reliable blockchain ecosystem. As you continue exploring Mamoru, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Sniffers can be integrated and customized to fit your specific security needs.
