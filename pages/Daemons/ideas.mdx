# Daemon Ideas - What to build
As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, the need for robust security measures becomes increasingly important. Mamoru offers a range of customizable daemons to help monitor and detect potential threats or malicious activities on various networks. The following list presents ten additional daemon ideas that can be implemented with Mamoru to enhance the security of your blockchain projects and ensure a safe environment for your users and assets:

1. **Detect unusual token transfers**: Monitor for large or unusual token transfers that might indicate suspicious activity or potential market manipulation.

2. **Detect rapid price fluctuations**: Identify instances where the price of a specific token fluctuates rapidly within a short time frame, potentially indicating market manipulation or pump-and-dump schemes.

3. **Detect minting of new tokens**: Monitor for the creation of new tokens, especially when they are minted in large quantities, which might indicate potential scams or fraud.

4. **Detect smart contract reentrancy attacks**: Monitor for potential reentrancy attacks on smart contracts, which could lead to unauthorized withdrawals or other malicious actions.

5. **Detect front-running attacks**: Identify transactions that attempt to take advantage of upcoming transactions by exploiting the ordering of transactions within a block.

6. **Detect abnormal contract interactions**: Monitor for unusual or unexpected interactions with a smart contract, such as excessive calls to specific functions, which might indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability.

7. **Detect excessive approval of token allowances**: Monitor for cases where an account approves an unusually large token allowance to another account, which might indicate a potential security risk or scam.

8. **Detect unusual staking or unstaking behavior**: Identify instances of abnormal staking or unstaking activities, such as rapid changes in staked amounts, which could signal market manipulation or other malicious actions.

9. **Detect abnormal transaction fee patterns**: Monitor for transactions with excessively high or low fees, which could indicate potential spamming, network congestion, or other issues.

10. **Detect smart contract self-destruction**: Monitor for instances where a smart contract is destroyed, potentially indicating an exit scam or attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

By implementing these additional daemons, Mamoru can provide a more comprehensive security solution for monitoring and detecting potential threats within the blockchain ecosystem.
