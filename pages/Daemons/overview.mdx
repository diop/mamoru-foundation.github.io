# Daemons

Welcome to the Daemons introduction page! In this section, we'll provide an overview of what daemons are, their role in the Mamoru ecosystem, and how they contribute to the security of the network.

## What are Daemons?

Daemons are user-defined monitoring scripts that operate within the Mamoru network to detect and report incidents based on customizable rules written in SQL or WASM. They serve as the primary building blocks of the Mamoru security system, enabling users to create tailored monitoring solutions to protect their assets and applications in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Functions of Daemons

Daemons perform several essential tasks within the Mamoru ecosystem:

1. **Custom Monitoring Rules:** Daemons allow users to define their monitoring logic using SQL queries or WASM code, providing flexibility and adaptability to various use cases and security requirements.

2. **Real-time Detection and Reporting:** Daemons continuously evaluate on-chain activities, detecting and reporting incidents to the validation chain as they occur, enabling rapid and automated defensive actions.

3. **Collaborative Security:** By allowing users to create, publish, and share daemons, Mamoru fosters a collaborative approach to security, enabling the community to contribute to and benefit from collective knowledge and expertise.

4. **Cross-Chain and Multi-Contract Capabilities:** Daemons can be designed to work across different blockchains and contracts, enabling the detection and prevention of complex threats and attack scenarios.

## How Daemons Enhance Security

Daemons play a pivotal role in the Mamoru security ecosystem. By enabling users to create and deploy custom monitoring scripts, daemons provide a versatile and adaptable solution for securing various blockchain assets and applications. Their real-time detection and reporting capabilities allow for swift response to potential threats, helping to mitigate risks and maintain the integrity of the network.

In summary, daemons are a critical component of the Mamoru network, providing customizable, real-time monitoring and detection to ensure a secure and reliable blockchain ecosystem. As you continue to explore Mamoru, you'll learn how to create, deploy, and manage daemons to fit your specific security needs.
