# Daemon Prerequisites
Before you start developing daemons for Mamoru, there are certain prerequisites you need to take care of. Ensuring that you have these prerequisites covered will make the process of developing daemons smoother and more efficient.

## Familiarity with Blockchain Technology
Since Mamoru is a blockchain-based platform, you should have a basic understanding of how blockchain technology works, including concepts such as decentralized networks, peer-to-peer connections, and smart contracts. This understanding is essential because it influences how daemons are developed and integrated into the Mamoru platform.

## Basic Knowledge of SQL
The Mamoru platform utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage the daemons. SQL is used to communicate with databases and perform tasks such as retrieving data, updating data, or controlling permissions. Thus, having a basic understanding of SQL and its syntax is a must.

## Basic Knowledge of WASM
WebAssembly (WASM) is a low-level, binary instruction format designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust. WASM enables the development of efficient, secure, and fast web applications, and it is used by Mamoru for executing custom rules in a sandboxed environment.

## Understanding of Node.js
Mamoru utilizes Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, for developing server-side applications. As a developer, you should be familiar with Node.js and how it operates. You will also need to have it installed on your local machine.

## Install the Mamoru CLI
The Mamoru command-line interface (CLI) is a crucial tool for developing daemons for the Mamoru platform. It is used to create, build, and manage your daemons. You should have it installed on your development machine.

## Knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript
Since Mamoru is built using JavaScript and TypeScript, it is imperative that you have a good understanding of these two languages. This includes knowing their syntax, structure, and basic concepts like variables, functions, and loops.
