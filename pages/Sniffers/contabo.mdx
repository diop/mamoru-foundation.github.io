# Deploy to Contabo
This guide provides instructions to install a Geth Node with the Mamoru SDK on a Contabo VPS. 

## VPS Requirements
Here are some rought estimates for running a Geth Ethereum node on Contabo:
```
VPS L SSD:

6 vCPU Cores
16 GB RAM
400 GB SSD Storage
Unmetered bandwidth
VPS XL SSD:

10 vCPU Cores
30 GB RAM
800 GB SSD Storage
Unmetered bandwidth
```

## Instructions
### Step 1: Log in to your Contabo VPS

First, access your Contabo VPS via SSH:
```shell
ssh root@your_VPS_IP
```

### Step 2: Update Your System
Before you start, ensure that your VPS is up to date:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### Step 3: Install Necessary Dependencies
You will need to install the required dependencies to compile the Geth client and Mamoru SDK:
```shell
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential golang-go
```

### Step 4: Clone and Build the Geth Client
Clone the go-ethereum repository and switch to the latest stable branch:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.git
cd go-ethereum
git checkout v1.11.5
```

Compile and install Geth:
```
make geth
```

### Step 5: Install the Mamoru SDK
Clone the Mamoru SDK repository:

```shell
go get github.com/Mamoru-Foundation/geth-mamoru-core-sdk
```

### Step 6: Configure Geth for Mamoru
Depending on your syncmode (--syncmode light, --syncmode full, or --syncmode snap), make the necessary changes to the go-ethereum files as mentioned in the Mamoru SDK README.

### Step 7: Export Mamoru Environment Variables
Set the required Mamoru environment variables:
```shell
export MAMORU_CHAIN_TYPE=<chain-type>
export MAMORU_SNIFFER_ENABLE=true
export MAMORU_PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key>
export MAMORU_CHAIN_ID=<validations-chain-id>
export MAMORU_ENDPOINT="https://validation-chain-url"
```

### Step 8: Run the Geth Node
Finally, run your Geth node with your desired network:
```
./build/bin/geth --goerli
```

If everything was done correctly, you should now have a running Geth node with the Mamoru SDK installed on your Contabo VPS!

### Note:
This guide assumes you are using the goerli test network. For mainnet or other testnets, replace --goerli with your desired network flag.

Please note that these instructions assume that you are comfortable with shell commands and have basic knowledge about Ethereum nodes. Always remember to replace placeholder values (like `your_VPS_IP`, `<chain-type>`, `<private-key>`, `<validations-chain-id>`, and `https://validation-chain-url`) with your actual values.
```
