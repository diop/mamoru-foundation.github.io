# Sniffer Installation Requirements

Welcome to the Sniffer Installation Requirements page! In this section, we'll outline the prerequisites and system requirements necessary to install and run sniffers within the Mamoru network.

## Prerequisites

Before installing a sniffer, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

1. **Docker:** Docker is a platform that allows you to build, deploy, and manage applications in containers. Mamoru sniffers are distributed as Docker images for easy deployment and management. [Download Docker here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Go:** Go is an open-source programming language used in the development of Mamoru sniffers. Ensure you have the latest version of Go installed. [Download Go here](https://golang.org/dl/).

3. **Rust:** Rust is another programming language used in Mamoru sniffers, especially for WASM-based daemons. Make sure you have the latest version of Rust installed. [Download Rust here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

4. **AssemblyScript:** AssemblyScript is a TypeScript-like language that compiles to WebAssembly (WASM). It is used for writing custom WASM-based daemons. [Download AssemblyScript here](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

## System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL2 for Docker compatibility)
- Memory: At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- Disk Space: At least 10GB free disk space
- Processor: A modern multi-core processor

## Network Requirements

In addition to the system requirements, ensure that your network meets the following conditions:

- Reliable and stable internet connection
- Access to the supported blockchain networks
- Open firewall ports to allow communication with the Mamoru network and relevant blockchain networks

After satisfying the prerequisites and system requirements, you're ready to install and deploy Mamoru sniffers. As you continue exploring the Mamoru documentation, you'll learn how to set up, configure, and manage your sniffers to enhance the security of your blockchain assets and applications.
