# Incident Reporting in Mamoru Network

Mamoru Network provides an efficient and reliable incident reporting system designed to facilitate the monitoring, detection, and notification of events within blockchain ecosystems. The system is built to integrate seamlessly with various blockchain environments, allowing developers to enhance their project's security and performance.

## Key Features of Incident Reporting in Mamoru Network

1. **Efficient Monitoring**: Mamoru Network is designed to monitor various blockchains constantly, enabling the detection of incidents in real-time. By leveraging the network's Daemons, developers can define custom incident detection logic using SQL queries or WASM code.

2. **Real-time Notifications**: The centralized platform listens to all events from the Validation Chain and dispatches notifications (SMS, email, webhook, Discord, etc.) to subscribers. Users can manually or programmatically subscribe to Daemon events and provide custom templates to format the data according to their preferences.

3. **Scalable and Flexible**: Mamoru Network's architecture is built to scale with growing blockchain ecosystems, ensuring that developers can rely on the network for comprehensive incident detection and reporting. The system's modularity allows for the easy addition of new Daemons, enabling the monitoring of new types of incidents as required.

4. **Reliable Reporting**: The Validation Chain is responsible for validating incoming incident reports, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the data within the network. By registering all essential data on the blockchain, Mamoru Network guarantees a reliable and tamper-proof incident reporting system.

Developers can integrate Mamoru Network's incident reporting system into their blockchain projects to enhance security, performance, and user experience. With its robust and flexible architecture, Mamoru Network is an ideal choice for managing and responding to incidents within blockchain ecosystems.
