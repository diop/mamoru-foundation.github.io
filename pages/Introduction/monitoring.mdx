# Monitoring and Detection

## Capabilities
Mamoru's real-time threat detection capabilities ensure that you are never left unaware of various cybersecurity threats that can impact blockchain systems. By continuously monitoring and analyzing blockchain activity, Mamoru helps protect against several attack vectors, including:

1. **Price Manipulation Attacks**: These attacks involve bad actors artificially altering the price of digital assets on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or price oracle services. Mamoru closely monitors trading activity and pricing data to identify suspicious price movements or manipulation attempts, enabling prompt response and mitigating potential damages.

2. **Transactions**: Mamoru constantly analyzes and validates all transactions on the network, looking for patterns or signs of fraudulent activity, such as double-spending attempts or unusually high gas fees. By monitoring transactions in real-time, Mamoru can detect and alert users to potential threats as they emerge.

3. **Reentrancy Attacks**: In these attacks, malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts by repeatedly calling a function before the original call is completed. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as draining funds from the smart contract. Mamoru actively monitors for signs of reentrancy attacks, detecting unusual or recursive function calls and helping to prevent potential exploits.

4. **Events and Call Traces**: Mamoru examines events and call traces generated by smart contracts to detect irregularities or signs of malicious activity. By closely monitoring these events and call traces, Mamoru can identify potential threats and respond accordingly.

5. **Flash-loan Attacks**: These attacks exploit the uncollateralized, instant borrowing feature of flash loans in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Attackers borrow assets, manipulate the market, and repay the loan in a single transaction, often causing significant losses for other users. Mamoru monitors for signs of flash-loan attacks, such as large, rapid transactions, and helps to mitigate their impact by detecting and responding to these threats in real-time.
