# WASM Daemon Development

WASM Daemons allow you to define incident matching logic using any language that can be compiled to WebAssembly.
Currently, only [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) is supported.
You can write a custom code against a blockchain context, decide when to emit an incident, customize message, severity, etc.
